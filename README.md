# ToDo-List
Created A ToDo List using html,css,php,sql
Topic/project description and technical details :
I have developed an online To-Do List, where multiple users can create multiple notes, objectives,lists and checklist/delete them once their objective is over.
The website allows users to signup/login into their profiles and access their lists, or create new ones, their inputs  being saved automatically in the database.


The login page asks for the name and password and the signup page asks for name , password and confirm password.
In the taskbar above there are three options, “ Home”, “ Login”,”SignUp”.
After entering the page,the taskbar buttons change to “ Home” , “Logout”, and  “Lists”, you can click any according to your choice. The website asks for the name of the list you wish to create or checks and enters if the list exists. After entering the list it shows the contents available and offers “ + “ button to add an item and “ ←” sign to delete an item. You can logout from the button above or the link present there.

Each time the user creates a new list,a new table is created in the database. He/She can create any number of tables  dynamically from two default tables itself.  That is the magic  of our project !
